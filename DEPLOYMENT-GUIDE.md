# 🚀 Deployment Guide - GitHub Pages

This guide will help you deploy CodeFix Pro to GitHub Pages so anyone can access it via a live URL!

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer
- This `Cursor-projects` folder ready to go

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top-right
3. Click **"New repository"**
4. **Repository name**: `Cursor-projects` (exactly this name!)
5. **Description**: "Professional code fixer - Fix bugs automatically in any language"
6. **Public** (must be public for free GitHub Pages)
7. **DON'T check** "Initialize with README" (we already have one)
8. Click **"Create repository"**

---

### Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

Open your terminal/command prompt in the `Cursor-projects` folder and run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the folder
cd C:\Users\carls_6h5f7os\OneDrive\Desktop\Cursor-projects

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial commit - CodeFix Pro"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
# Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username!
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Cursor-projects.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Example** (if your GitHub username is `johndoe`):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/Cursor-projects.git
```

---

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Cursor-projects`
2. Click **"Settings"** (top of the page)
3. Click **"Pages"** in the left sidebar (under "Code and automation")
4. Under **"Source"**, select:
   - Branch: **main**
   - Folder: **/ (root)**
5. Click **"Save"**
6. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

### Step 4: Access Your Live Website!

Your CodeFix Pro is now live at:

```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Repository not found" when pushing
- Make sure you replaced `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username
- Check that the repository exists on GitHub

### "403 Forbidden" error
- Make sure your repository is **public** (not private)
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in settings

### Website shows 404
- Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages
- Make sure the URL includes `Codefixpro.html` at the end
- Check that `Codefixpro.html` is in the root folder (not in a subfolder)

### Website loads but doesn't work
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled
- Try a different browser
